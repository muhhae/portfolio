## Short Description

This project tried to classify correct pronounciation from the word "City" with CNN 1D.

## Datasets

Our team collect our own datasets and then using Google API to classify the word. You can check it on [Code](#Code) section

## Code

-   [Project Workspace](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1LRR3OiXHEtHIacqi3tQbiRMbV1dmJa43)

## How it works

-   First we get mel spectogram from our audio with librosa.feature.melspectogram function and then resize it to (128,128)

    picture above is how it looks when we visualize it.

-   Because our data is very we use Data Augmentation to make of it. This is our data count
    <br /> Original Data : 141
    <br /> Augmented Data : 423
    <br /> Total Data : 564
    <br /> Train : 451
    <br /> Test : 113
-   After that we setup our model with Keras Library. This is how our model looks like.

-   This is the result of our model
