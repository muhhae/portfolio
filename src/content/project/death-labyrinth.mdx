## Description

[Death Labyrinth](https://muhhae.itch.io/death-labyrinth)
is my hobby project that i made for
Space Game Jam to spend my time before attending university.
In this game you need to escape from procedurally generated
labyrinth on space by destroying space crystal that you need to find.

## Tech Stack

-   Unity - Its basically a go to game engine at that
    time because of its simplicity and lightweight load on my potato PC
-   C# - Well it's used in unity.

## Code

-   Missing - I forgot to backup my project before reinstalling my pc. SADGE

## Explanation

As far as I remember, my code basically just randomly instatiating room in a way that it all connected. And then instantiating crystal and monster on it.
